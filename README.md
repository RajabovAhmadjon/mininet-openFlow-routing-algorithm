# Assignment on Mininet/OpenFlow and Routing Algorithm
## Module: Telecommunications Systems and Quality of Services (EE4029)

This laboratory work is based on virtual networks on a PC. Which uses the power of modern PCs to model and evaluate various systems without the need for real system implementation. This allows us to easily configure a virtual network and test its various functions. Furthermore, it helps to understand the behavior of various components, network parameters and how they are related to each other. Two tasks are based on Mininet. Mininet is a network emulator that creates a network of virtual hosts, switches, controllers and communication channels. MININET hosts are running Linux, and the switches support OpenFlow. OpenFlow is a communications protocol that provides access to forwarding from a switch or router to a controller. This protocol can run a software-defined network SDN. 
In the first task, we created a network in a Mininet and analyzed it. We also became familiar with the basic commands for working with the Minnet. In the second task, we analyzed network packets and modified the OpenFlow switch tables. In the last task, we implemented a routing algorithm in a virtual network by developing software.
